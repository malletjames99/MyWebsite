The negotiations between MLB team owners and the MLBPA have ramped up in recent days, with both sides starting to exchange proposals for bringing professional baseball back in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Regardless of how the economics and COVID testing protocols shake out in those agreements, everyone knows that the 2020 MLB season will be unlike any other not just in recent memory, but in all of baseball history. Fan-less stadiums seem to be a forgone conclusion. Same with the universal DH and an expanded playoffs. Changes to the league’s schedule and structure have had a few more sticking points, with many different proposals still on the table.

One of the first ideas was [playing baseball only at spring training sites in Arizona or Florida](https://www.yesnetwork.com/news/mlb-could-start-play-at-spring-training-sites-313218210). This idea was shut down relatively quickly as many logistical issues engulfed the plan and players are not particularly keen on leaving their families for months on end.

Momentum is gathering for teams to play games in their home ballparks, but with unprecedented divisional alignments to cut down on travel distance. An MLB proposal in late April would restructure the league [into three 10-team divisions](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/columnist/bob-nightengale/2020/04/28/mlb-optimistic-about-starting-season-late-june/3039275001/), essentially just combining divisions in the opposite leagues with one another (the only swap would be Pittsburgh and Atlanta). Teams would only play within their division. How much, if at all, does this restructuring help cut down the travel distance compared to using the traditional five 6-team division format?

MLB’s three 10-team division alignment is listed in the table below. The second table lists the total distance traveled for every team in the division to play every other team in the division once (for a total of 45 matchups). The third table shows the total distance traveled over a 108 game season, which each team plays four 3-game series against each division opponent.

Most of the East division is in the northeast, but needs to make the long trips to Florida to play the Rays and Marlins. The Central is fairly compact outside of the trip to Atlanta. The West, though, needs to deal with multiple long trips into relative no man’s land: Seattle, Colorado, and the two Texas teams are quite a ways away from the five California teams plus Arizona. All told, each team would travel around 10,500 miles from their home ballpark during the course of a 108 game season.

What if major league baseball wanted to keep their current division alignment? To reach the same number of games, each team could play the four teams in their division in nine 3-game series. The analysis from above is repeated in the tables below.

MLB’s 3 x 10 alignment saves about 500 miles per team compared to the standard 6 x 5 alignment over the course of a proposed 108 game season.

One option that I have explored to try to keep the normal 6 divisions of 5 teams that we have all grown accustomed to since the Astros switched from the NL Central to AL West in 2013 is to significantly decrease travel within divisions by realigning NL and AL teams to divisions that strictly reflect their region of the nation and Canada. 

I have settled on the following solution to minimize travel and keep the 5-team division structure that is important to the game. The realignment would allow for some semblance of normalcy in the 2020 season and help to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 virus.

If the focus is to cut down on travel time while maintaining the current MLB structure, nearly 100,000 miles of one-way travel could be saved when compared to the three division proposal. It is very clear that the travel burden would not be particularly spread evenly among every team; the South and the “Northwest” division would travel 3-4 times as much as the next lowest division but lots of potentially unnecessary travel would be saved. There would be a lack of variety in matchups in this scenario compared to the 10 team divisions but there could easily be a plan put in place for limited inter-division play based on closest neighboring division teams where not all 108 games would have to come from teams in the same division.

[In a normal MLB season division opponents play each other 76 times](https://gothamsn.com/is-it-time-to-revisit-the-mlb-playoff-structure-9ea4e801efae), depending on how many games are in each series this would mean that teams travel to division opponents and complete the cycle of each division opponent playing each other once anywhere between 24-26 times a season. When comparing the optimized 6 x 5 division setup to the current division alignment this new setup would save in the neighborhood of 300,900 miles of single division travel over the course of a standard MLB season. 1,805,232 total travel miles would be saved in division play alone across all of major league baseball.

# Methodology

To find the mileages in the analysis I used the latitude and longitude coordinates for each ballpark and found the straight-line distances between each of the major league ballparks. There were originally 870 team to team mileages calculated, all 29 opponents for each of the 30 teams, obviously with quite a few duplicate mileages. Next, I found the 30 choose 5, 142506 possible division combinations and broke each of those down into their 5 choose 2, 10 possible division matchups and merged each matchup with its corresponding mileage difference. I added each of the 10 mileages generated to create a within division one-way mileage sum and used that value to determine what division formats would be optimal from a purely distance perspective.

The 6 x 5 solution that I came up with is not definitively the optimal solution but I think it is very close given the requirement of 6 divisions with 5 teams. I arrived at the solution by looking at a K-means generated cluster plot and used the clusters determined by K-means along with the location of the latitude, longitude coordinates to determine which teams would make the most sense to be grouped together. K-means determines the number of k clusters but does not create clusters of equal size so I used the plot below along with the division combination mileage dataset to perform some trial and error and logically work through what division combinations would make the most sense with minimal distance being the only requirement.

### K-Means Clustered MLB Divisions

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

When first considering a plan to determine optimal division structure I thought a few teams would have to be paired together in the same division with no question. Those teams included NYY-NYM, BAL-WSN, LAD-LAA, OAK-SFG, and CHC-CHW. I found that I would be correct on 4 of those 5 pairs. The Baltimore-Washington combo required some additional consideration. The optimal 6 division approach that I determined does not include the 5-team combination that would require the least amount of mileage, that division would include WSN-BAL-PHI-NYY-NYM, this 5-team division would only require 1214.1 miles total for each team to play each other one time. When considering the bigger picture though, Boston like Seattle but to a lesser degree, sits on an island and needs to be included in a division. Being paired with the NYY-NYM-PHI-BAL group makes the most sense since its proximity to any of the other teams or groups of teams is so far.

Although it is somewhat unfortunate for the Nationals to miss out on such a tightly grouped division it makes the most sense to keep them in what I came up with as the Great Lakes division which includes PIT-DET-CLE-WSN-TOR. When comparing this setup to the possibility where Baltimore is grouped with the other Great Lakes teams, we actually add 15 miles to each time the entire division plays each other once. The reasoning behind this though is that including the Nationals with the other Northeast teams adds 136 miles to the total division mileage compared to what the total would be when Baltimore is included. So, by grouping Baltimore with the Northeast teams and Washington with the Great Lakes teams we save 121 miles. 

The Baltimore-Washington edge scenario was definitely the toughest dispute when it came to determining where two teams should be grouped. Creating the South division was straight forward since there is a clear 5 team group in the South-Southeast portion of the US which includes TBR-MIA-ATL-TEX-HOU. The Midwest division came fairly easily as well since there is a clear triangle of teams surrounding the Chicago area. This group includes CHC-CHW-STL-MIL-CIN. Next came the decision of how to determine what combination of 5 teams would make up the West division and what to do about the Mariners. The closest team to the Mariners is the Giants, there is a 680-mile difference between the two cities, this is the largest discrepancy between a team that is considered closest to another team. The second furthest such scenario is the difference between Colorado and their closest opponent, Kansas City which is a 555-mile difference. Seattle is on an island considering the current MLB landscape which makes it very hard to come up with a scenario to optimize their travel distance and the travel distance of other teams that will be in their division.

Keeping this in mind, I began approaching the west by considering the 5 teams that are closest in proximity which include OAK-SFG-LAA-LAD-SDP, I found no way to reduce the inter-division mileage of 2558 miles of travel in this group by including what would be the closest outsider in the Arizona Diamondbacks. Having San Francisco and Oakland as somewhat of an outlier pair relative to the center of the 6 teams k-means clustered in the Southwest United States means that they carry much more weight in the division setup. When considering that maybe including Arizona would create an optimal 4 team division over either of the Bay area teams with the LA center group one might wonder how Arizona is left out. Since we are dealing with 5 team divisions, they have to be on the outside looking in as there is no reason to split up the Bay Area teams and no other logical group of 3 teams to include with them.

Determining how the West division played out left us with 5 teams. I thought at first that I would need to backtrack given that those 5 teams included Seattle, Arizona, Colorado, Minnesota, and Kansas City but when seeing a total mileage of 9605 I was quite happy with how it played out. Even though 9605 miles is by far the largest travel burden of any division, a division with Seattle will always require the most travel. It is almost 2000 miles less in total than teams are required to travel in the current AL West to play each other one time. The optimal 5 team division for the Mariners would include SEA-SFG-OAK-LAD-LAA which would create a division that would require 4760 miles of travel. That would leave SDP-ARI-COL-KCR-MIN as kind of the leftover 5 team division and an 8569-mile travel requirement. This creates a smaller maximum division mileage that also doesn't include Seattle but also adds a little over 1000 miles to the larger picture which would not create an optimal scenario.

The new 6 x 5 division structure totals 24,886 miles each time division opponents play each other one time. In the current division landscape 36,458 miles of total travel are required when each division plays each other one time. The new division alignment structure would save 11,572 miles each cycle of division opponents playing each other. 

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic the season will almost certainly be shortened in some way. There is no doubt that this new division setup will save a large amount of travel and reduce the spread of the virus much more effectively than we would see in the normal 5 team division setup and possibly the newly proposed 10 team division alignment. 

I also explored the possibility of keeping the AL and NL teams together in the 6 division setup but the only way that I found to optimize the current AL/NL division travel landscape would be to swap the Pirates from the NL Central to NL East and have the Braves take their place in the NL Central which would save about 300 miles each time division opponents played each other. From what I have found the AL divisions are already optimized for distance proximity. I do not think there are any changes to make to decrease division travel in the American League. That being said, I don’t think it would be worth keeping the leagues together to try to slow the spread of the virus. 

I think the scenario where all 30 teams, regardless of league, are restructured into 6 divisions of 5 teams makes the most sense. Given this structure, we will still have the division framework that MLB fans are accustumed to while significantly reducing travel and allowing for baseball to finally be played in 2020.
