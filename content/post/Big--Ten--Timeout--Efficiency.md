## Big Ten Men's Basketball Perfomance Out of Elected Timeouts in the 2020 Season

![Efficiency Chart](https://i.imgur.com/V7KoRd6.png)

Big Ten basketball, in my mind, is the most fun and competitive basketball to watch in all of the college game. No matter if it is 1 versus 2 in the conference standings, 13 versus 14, or 1 versus 14 so many Big Ten conference games come down to the final possession and are close the whole way which makes every game a must watch for fans. Since the margin between teams is so small so many of the intrcacies of the game become extremely important and many times are the deciding factor when it comes to who wins or loses. With this in my mind, I set out to explore one of the intracacies of the Big Ten game and look at performance out of elected timeouts.

I started by diving into play by play data and took a look at how many points were scored by teams in the possession directly after an elected timeout was called and how many points were given up by that team in the possession directly after a timeout. I calculated timeout efficiency using the formula below:

Using the efficiency values that I found I created the visual above, it is clear that Mark Turgeon and the Terps almost lapped the field as a clear number 1 in timeout efficiency, scoring .708 more points than their opponent per elected timeout called. This comes as no surprise since Maryland finished atop the Big Ten regular season standings. Maryland was behind only Iowa for least timeouts called among Big Ten teams this season but the Terps made the most out of the 60 timeouts that they called and were sure to defend their opponent out of a timeout as well. 

When the ball was in the hands of Maryland after a timeout they were close to unstoppable, averaging 1.567 points per timeout called while giving up only .859 points in the possssion after their opponent called a timeout. These are truly remarkable figures and speak to Maryland's ability to execute both offensviely and defensively out of a timeout. Their overall offensive efficiency on the year was .912 and their overall defensive efficiency on the year was .835 so while they held their opponents to almost exactly what they scored on any other possession during the year they improved their own scoring output by more than .6 points any time a timeout was called. 

Anthony Cowan lead the Terps in scoring after timeouts called with 24 points total scored after timeouts on the season but maybe what made the Terps so successful was their balanced scoring out of timeouts. After Cowan, Eric Ayala, Jalen Smith, Daryl Morsell, and Aaron Wiggins all scored between 12-15 points a man which speaks to the Terps ability to look beyond one or two stars and attack from all angles of the lineup after a timeout was called.

Moving on from Maryland, one of the more interesting revalations that came from this endeavor was seeing how poorly Minnesota performed compared to the rest of the league out of timeouts. With a timeout efficiency of -.752 they were just as bad as Maryland was good in efficiency out of timeouts in the 2020 season. They scored only .650 points per timeout while giving up 1.402 points per timeout. 

After taking a deeper look into the Gophers' trouble I found that they were 4 of 20 from three out of elected timeouts on the season, good for 20%, much less than their 33.7% average from three on the year, which was average at best among D1 teams. I'm not sure if Richard Pitino's quick hitters weren't working as planned or if the Gophers simply were not making shots out of timeouts but it is clear that drawing up a play with the three ball in mind did not end in much success this year for Minnesota out of timeouts. Gabe Kalscheur was 2 for 8 out of those timeouts and really never found his stroke this entire season shooting 34% from three on 223 attempts a big step back from last year when he shot 41% on 188 attempts.

It's nice to know which teams performed the best out of timeouts but what I really wanted to find is which Big Ten teams used timeouts the most to their advantage, that is which teams found the most added efficiency increase in possessions after the timeout.

It is clear from the graphs above that Maryland was a standout performer on both the offensive and defensive end overall and especially out of timeouts. A team that was below average compared to other Big Ten teams on the year in terms of offensive efficiency but was well above average in offensive efficiency out of timeouts was Matt Painter's Boilermakers. Purdue scored 0.915 points per possession on the season but upped that number considerably out of timeouts to 1.359. Eric Hunter Jr. led the way for Purdue out of elected timeouts with 21 points on the season and got to the foul line the most out of timeouts compared to anyone on his team.

In terms of added defensive efficiency Penn State did quite well defending an opponent's possession out of an elected timeout. Penn State was an above average team defensively on all possessions but stood out as second best in defensive efficiency out of timeouts in the Big Ten. Penn State allowed .939 points out of their opponents elected timeouts which was only about a tenth of a point more than they gave up on any other defensive possession. Patrick Chambers and the Nittany Lions pride their success on the defensive end and it certainly showed out of the timeout huddle.

The bar plots above are another way to help visualize production added out of timeout, on the offfensive end points added shows how much better a team performed out of elected timeouts compared to their normal offensive efficiency. Defensively, defensive points added show how much more a team gave up when their opponent called a timeout, ideally you would want this number to be as low as possible.

There's no doubt that when looking at these numbers Maryland dominated out of elected timeouts this year but teams like Wisconsin, Purdue, and Penn State also showed added production out of timeouts. There is a lot to build on in this analysis such as expanding to other conferences, taking a look at past years, and maybe most interestingly taking a look to see if there are any patterns in the production of specific coaches from year to year out of elected timeouts. Adding in production out of all timeouts might also help the analysis with a larger number of samples to pull from. It was a fun project that I will certainly revisit.
