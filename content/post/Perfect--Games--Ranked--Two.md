In now our second installment of a 4-part series where we attempt to rank all 21 perfect games in the modern era using a numbers only approach, we start to take a closer look at some of the middle tier likelihood perfect games. Some terrific names and stories are featured in this section including the legendary Roy Halladay, David Wells, and Jim Bunning. We introduced our ranking method using Bradley-Terry in our introductory post [here](https://www.maljames.com/post/perfect-games/).

### 15. Mike Witt vs. Texas Rangers B-T Probability: 97 in 100,000

On the final day of the 1984 regular season Mike Witt threw a perfect game in Arlington against the Texas Rangers. It was basically a moot game going in, both the Rangers and California Angels were out of the AL West playoff race and just looked to finish the season on a high note. Mike Witt did just that, putting on a performance that was certainly an octave or two higher than anyone might have expected to complete the season.

Witt was just 24 when he threw his perfect game, rounding off a season that was by far the best of his first four years in bigs and sparked some pretty solid years to follow in the mid-80s. By most statistical measures Witt had an above average year in 1984, he posted a 116 ERA+, and at the time a significantly above average 7.2 SO9 which would go on to be the best of his career. 

Witt won yet another perfect game 1-0, 1-0 is the most common final score of all perfect games, 6 of the 21 perfect games in the modern era ended 1-0. Witt faced a Rangers lineup that was pretty subpar, a 69-91 team coming into the final game of the season. The core of the Ranger lineup was Gary Ward, Larry Parrish, and Pete O’ Brien each of whom posted an OBP of above .330 which would qualify as about 10 points above average in the 1984 season. No one else that stepped in the box for the Rangers touted above a league average On-Base Percentage. Not the toughest lineup Witt may have faced in the year and his .306 POBP didn’t hold him back as he K’d 10 batters and took part in only the second sub-two hour perfect game since 1966.

Only 8,375 fans took in the game live in Arlington making Witt’s game the worst attended perfect game of the last 35+ years.



### 14. Jim Bunning vs.  B-T Probability: 92 in 100,000

### 13. Roy Halladay vs. Florida Marlins B-T Probability: 81 in 100,000

The 2nd perfect game in Phillies’ history was thrown by Phil’s legend and hall of famer Roy Halladay. Doc threw the perfect game in Florida at Sun Life ballpark making it the 6th ever perfect game thrown on the road, only 7 of the 21 perfect games to date have been thrown away from the pitcher’s home park.

The Phillies Marlins matchup in early 2010 featured two Aces of the NL East at the time, Roy and everyone’s favorite forgotten MLB pitcher, Josh Johnson, who at the time was coming off of a 2009 all star campaign in which he posted a 15-5 record. Fans in attendance may have been hoping for a pitcher’s duel and they got just that. 

Wilson Valdez scored an unearned run for the Phils in the top half of the 3rd off of a line drive hit by Chase Utley that was mis-played in center field by Cameron Maybin. It ended up being the only run scored in the game. The Phillies did have 7 hits in the game, 4 of which came from the 7 and 8 spots in the order (Jason Castro and Carlos Ruiz), they just couldn’t string them together to score many runs. Luckily the run they did score was more than enough for Doc to work with that day.

Now 9 spots into our perfect game rankings we are starting to find lineups that should have been tougher for pitchers to work their way through. Batters 2-6 in the Marlins order were all quite formidable, headlined by Hanley Ramirez, a very tough out at the time. 2010 was basically the end of Hanley’s prime as one of the best shortstops in the league, his OBP was .378 in 2010 and he had a wRC+ of 127 which he has only bested two other times in his career since. The likes of Jorge Cantu, Dan Uggla, and Cody Ross were also in the lineup, Ross was the only batter in the top 6 who Roy did not strikeout. It was quite a decent lineup with few no names, the pitching performances here on out will have required quite a bit more skill. 

With a POBP of .269 at the time, Halladay ranks 6th best among pitchers having thrown a perfect game. Even though the lineup was tougher than those we have seen so far Halladay’s ability to keep runners off base at the time was some of the best of anyone to throw a perfect game. Halladay also may have been one of the best in recent MLB history at staying sharp through the entirety of 9 innings. Roy led all of baseball in complete games for 5 years straight from 2007-2011. His endurance and relentless nature kept him at the top of the game for many years, he had an extra gear that when kicked in not many others could match. He is one of only 6 players with both a perfect game and no-hitter to their credit. 


### 12. Matt Cain vs. B-T Probability: 75 in 100,000

### 11. David Wells vs. Minnesota Twins B-T Probability: 73 in 100,000

Sunday, May 17th, 1998 held the 2nd perfect game in Yankee history. In a year that David Wells led all the majors in win percentage, posting a 18-4 record, he was no stranger to 9 innings of work. He threw 5 shutouts in ‘98 which was the most of any pitcher in the major leagues that year. 

Wells was pitching very well coming into the game against the Twins and came up against a relatively average lineup that featured a 41-year-old Paul Molitor batting 3rd. Only one player in the Twins lineup that day would go on to post an OPS+ of over 100 that year, outfielder Matt Lawton. Lawton may have been seeing the baseball best that day against Wells at Yankee Stadium, as he stung a pair of fly balls and was one of only two Twins not to post a strikeout.

There was no dangerous on-base threat in the Minnesota 9 that day other than Lawton but it was an American league lineup that featured more quality than we’ve seen in the back end of the lineup.
Wells ran through a lineup that we would expect to see perfection against only 7 times in 10,000 tries, according to the Bradley-Terry model, no small feat. Wells struck out 11 batters which left 10 flyouts and six groundouts to total the 27 outs while facing the minimum. 

Maybe most impressively, Wells has been famously noted to have thrown his perfect game while hungover after a long night out in the Big Apple until somewhere around 5:30am.  He rallied and toed the rubber at 1:30pm that afternoon; the rest is truly baseball history.
