In the first installment of a 4-part series where we attempt to rank all 21 perfect games in the modern era using a numbers only appraoch, we take a closer look at the most likely of the perfect games thrown in Major League Baseball since 1900. Greats like Cy Young and Addie Joss fall in the section along with lesser known names like Len Barker. We introduced our ranking method using Bradley-Terry in our introductory post [here](https://www.maljames.com/post/perfect-games/).

### 15. Mike Witt vs. Texas Rangers B-T Probability: 97 in 100,000

 On the final day of the 1984 regular season Mike Witt threw a perfect game in Arlington against the Texas Rangers. It was basically a moot game going in, both the Rangers and California Angels were out of the AL West playoff race and just looked to finish the season on a high note. Mike Witt did just that, putting on a performance that was certainly an octave or two higher than anyone might have expected to complete the season.

Witt was just 24 when he threw his perfect game, rounding off a season that was by far the best of his first four years in bigs and sparked some pretty solid years to follow in the mid-80s. By most statistical measures Witt had an above average year in 1984, he posted a 116 ERA+, and at the time a significantly above average 7.2 SO9 which would go on to be the best of his career. 

Witt won yet another perfect game 1-0, 1-0 is the most common final score of all perfect games, 6 of the 21 perfect games in the modern era ended 1-0. Witt faced a Rangers lineup that was pretty subpar, a 69-91 team coming into the final game of the season. The core of the Ranger lineup was Gary Ward, Larry Parrish, and Pete O’ Brien each of whom posted an OBP of above .330 which would qualify as about 10 points above average in the 1984 season. No one else that stepped in the box for the Rangers touted above a league average On-Base Percentage. Not the toughest lineup Witt may have faced in the year and his .306 POBP didn’t hold him back as he K’d 10 batters and took part in only the second sub-two hour perfect game since 1966.

Only 8,375 fans took in the game live in Arlington making Witt’s game the worst attended perfect game of the last 35+ years.



### 14. Jim Bunning vs.  B-T Probability: 92 in 100,000

### 13. Roy Halladay vs. Florida Marlins B-T Probability: 81 in 100,000

![Perfect Game Halladay](https://i.imgur.com/fNc32w0.png)

The 2nd perfect game in Phillies’ history was thrown by Phil’s legend and hall of famer Roy Halladay. Doc threw the perfect game in Florida at Sun Life Stadium making it the 6th ever perfect game thrown on the road, only 7 of the 21 perfect games to date have been thrown away from the pitcher’s home ballpark.

The Phillies Marlins matchup in early 2010 featured two Aces of the NL East at the time, Roy and everyone’s favorite forgotten MLB pitcher, Josh Johnson, who at the time was coming off of a 2009 all star campaign in which he posted a 15-5 record. Fans in attendance may have been hoping for a pitcher’s duel and they got just that. 

Wilson Valdez scored an unearned run for the Phils in the top half of the 3rd off of a line drive hit by Chase Utley that was mis-played in center field by Cameron Maybin. It ended up being the only run scored in the game. The Phillies did have 7 hits in the game, 4 of which came from the 7 and 8 spots in the order (Jason Castro and Carlos Ruiz), they just couldn’t string them together to score many runs. Luckily the run they did score was more than enough for Doc to work with that day.

Now 9 spots into our perfect game rankings we are starting to find lineups that should have been tougher for pitchers to work their way through. Batters 2-6 in the Marlins order were all quite formidable, headlined by Hanley Ramirez, a very tough out at the time. 2010 was basically the end of Hanley’s prime as one of the best shortstops in the league, his OBP was .378 in 2010 and he had a wRC+ of 127 which he has only bested two other times in his career since. The likes of Jorge Cantu, Dan Uggla, and Cody Ross were also in the lineup, Ross was the only batter in the top 6 who Roy did not strikeout. It was quite a decent lineup with few no names, the pitching performances here on out will have required quite a bit more skill. 

With a POBP of .269 at the time, Halladay ranks 6th best among pitchers having thrown a perfect game. Even though the lineup was tougher than those we have seen so far Halladay’s ability to keep runners off base at the time was some of the best of anyone to throw a perfect game. Halladay also may have been one of the best in recent MLB history at staying sharp through the entirety of 9 innings. Roy led all of baseball in complete games for 5 years straight from 2007-2011. His endurance and relentless nature kept him at the top of the game for many years, he had an extra gear that when kicked in not many others could match. He is one of only 6 players with both a perfect game and no-hitter to their credit. 


### 18. Sandy Koufax vs. Chicago Cubs B-T Probability: 120 in 100,000

![Perfect Game Koufax](https://i.imgur.com/NAoUqZz.png)

In September 1965, Dodgers ace Sandy Koufax threw a perfect game against the Chicago Cubs. The game is notable for its general lack of offense; Koufax’s opposing pitcher, Bob Hendley, held onto a no-hitter until the seventh inning and the only run that scored was the result of a walk, sacrifice bunt, and an overthrow on a stolen base attempt. Overall, only two runners reached base during the entire game, a major league record for a full nine inning game.

The lineup that Koufax faced was very top-heavy, with three Hall of Famers in Billy Williams, Ron Santo, and Ernie Banks. All three made the 1965 All Star Game, with Williams and Banks each putting up elite 7.7 bWAR seasons, while an aging Banks still mustered 1.9 bWAR. Despite this murderer’s row in the middle of the order, Koufax’s performance was still relatively likely compared to other perfect games (albeit still extremely unlikely as a whole) because the rest of the Cubs’ lineup was, to put it lightly, not good. In fact, each one of the remaining six hitters in the Cubs lineup was below replacement level in 1965.

Two Cubs starters, leadoff center fielder Don Young and left fielder Byron Browne, had been called up in the days prior and made their major league debut that night. Neither would ever make much of an impact-- after 1965, Young would not play another MLB game until 1969, and Browne somehow led the National League in strikeouts in 1966 despite playing only 120 games, hopping between the majors and minors in the years following. Hendley, as good as he was on the mound, was equally terrible with the bat, never reaching base and striking out in 12 of his 17 at bats in 1965. He didn’t help his own cause against the Dodgers, as he struck out in both of his at bats before being lifted for pinch hitter Harvey Kuenn in the top of the ninth, who fittingly enough also struck out.

Hendley and Kuenn weren’t Koufax’s only strikeout victims that night. In fact, 10 out of the 11 batters that stepped into the batter’s box struck out at least once. Koufax’s 14 strikeouts are a record for a perfect game, and he is the only pitcher to strike out at least one batter in each inning of his perfect game.

### 17. Felix Hernandez vs. Tampa Bay Rays B-T Probability: 107 in 100,000

![Perfect Game Hernandez](https://i.imgur.com/joE2USY.png)

The most recent perfect game was on August 15th, 2012, the conclusion of a three-part saga of perfection that year featuring Humber, Cain and Hernandez. Felix Hernandez faced off against what was a weak Tampa Bay Rays lineup at the time albeit headlined by longtime Rays standout Evan Longoria. 

Though the lineup he threw to was somewhat weak, the lineup that he relied on for run support was quite a sad story in itself. At the time the man leading the lineup in OPS and batting fourth for the Mariners was John Jaso, certainly less of a liability at the plate than behind it but still not a guy to hang your hat on to lead a major league offense. Other notable names in the Seattle lineup that day included Michael Saunders, Eric Thames, Justin Smoak, and the only current Mariner that took the field that day, Kyle Seager. Every name mentioned has swung the bat well in some part of their major league career but found a way to keep fans engaged in the final outcome that day with perfection in the making. The Mariners lineup was no stranger to perfect games in 2012 as we will touch on later, having gone through one of their own. There was only one run scored in the game, the Mariners won it 1-0.

Probably the most interesting note from this game is that it was the third time the Rays were the victim of a perfect game in a 4-year span. An unfortunate stretch that probably will not be bested by another major league team any time soon. The four batters that were in the lineup for all 3 perfect games include Longoria, Carlos Pena, Melvin Upton, and super-utility man Ben Zobrist. Zobrist is a guy that really has no business being on the short list of batters that have seen the most perfect games firsthand. His 13.6 Whiff%, 91.5 Zone Contact%, and 74.2 Chase Contact% are all well above major league average since 2015 and speak to how hard it is to keep him off base. Hitting a major league pitcher is tough for even those who see the ball best, over a small sample size of 9 ABs I guess it’s hard to be too surprised by anything.

A little bit about Felix, he had a POBP of .295, (allowed a runner on base about 29.5% of ABs) in 2012 which is about average among pitchers having thrown a perfect game, still a strong mark though among all major league pitchers. He struck out 12 in the game, the first 11 all swinging and then the game ended with a strikeout looking from Sean Rodriguez. Hernandez faced a Rays lineup with an OBP of .320 that year, slightly above the average .312 OBP among lineups that have seen perfect games. All in all, Felix’s bid was fairly average in the scope of perfect games, obviously any of the 21 is an extremely rare feat but nothing too out of the ordinary in this one. 27 up, 27 down, and King Felix picked up another spectacular honor in what has been a very nice career.

### 16. Tom Browning vs. Los Angeles Dodgers B-T Probability: 104 in 100,000

![Perfect Game Browning](https://i.imgur.com/CDvyAMI.png)

The Cincinnati Reds’ Tom Browning twirled a perfect game versus the Los Angeles Dodgers on September 16, 1988. Contrary to most other victims of perfect games, the Dodgers were actually a formidable opponent and even went on to win the World Series later the same season. They featured the eventual NL MVP Kirk Gibson along with contributors like Steve Sax, Mike Marshall, and John Shelby. However, the Dodgers won more so on the back of terrific pitching, with Cy Young winner Orel Hershiser and an elite bullpen contributing to the team’s combined 2.96 ERA.

While it’s challenging to make too much of the Dodgers’ offensive limitations given that they were later crowned the best team in baseball, they featured a few hitters that skewed Browning’s perfecto towards the bottom of the list. Notably, the Dodgers threw shortstop Alfredo Griffin in the leadoff spot, despite his .255 OBP at the time (that’s pre-Moneyball era for you!). Third baseman Jeff Hamilton further damaged the Dodgers’ fortunes with a pedestrian batting average of .236 batting average compiled with a complete inability to draw walks: only 10 in 327 plate appearances. Dodgers pitcher Tim Belcher threw a three-hit gem, but was not known for his abilities at the plate and was a non-factor on that front.

Browning’s perfect game was unique in several ways. Rain caused a two hour and twenty-seven minute delay to the beginning of the game, making it one of two perfect games to undergo a rain delay and also the perfect game with the latest first pitch, at 10:02 PM local time. It was the first and only perfect game thrown on artificial turf, as well. Browning, a quality but not elite pitcher, took an unusual number of no hitters deep into ballgames. Earlier in the 1988 season, he had a no hitter going into the ninth until Tony Gwynn broke it up with one out. The next season, he took another perfect game into the ninth inning until Phillies infielder Dickie Thon knocked a double into the right-center gap.
