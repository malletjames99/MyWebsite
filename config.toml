    <p> My name is Mallet James and I am currently an AI/ML Engineer at PPG Industries. I graduated from Penn State University in spring 2021 with an undergraduate degree in Applied Data Science. My greatest interest in the field of Data Science is sports analytics and the application of statistics to sports. I am the founder and a former president of the <a href="https://sites.psu.edu/ssaclub/"><font color="blue">Penn State Sports Analytics Club</font></a>. In my time at Penn State, I worked alongside Penn State Men's Basketball team and Penn State Track & Field providing help with strategy and data analysis. I previously contributed to StatHouse Analytics, where I helped the team with development and various data science tasks in the context of college basketball.</p>
    <br />
    <p>My main interests in the area of sports analytics include basketball, baseball, and golf. I also enjoy predictive analytics and statistical modeling.</p>
